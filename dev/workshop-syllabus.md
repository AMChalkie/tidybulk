# Tidy Transcriptomics [SOME OTHER TITLE?]

Dr. Maria Doyle (EMAIL) and Dr. Stefano Mangiola (EMAIL)

# Workshop Description

This workshop will show you how to perform analysis of RNA-Seq count data in a 'tidy' way using the tidyBulk and tidyHeatmap packages. 
tidyBulk provides a modular framework and a tidy data structure for bulk transcriptional analyses. tidyHeatmap provides a tidy implementation for creating heatmaps. These packages are part of a tidy transcriptomics suite for tidy and user-friendly grammar of RNA sequencing data exploration and analysis. 

- preprocess count data
- perform differential expression analysis
- visualise gene expression data

## Pre-requisites

* Basic knowledge of RStudio
* Familiarity with tidyverse syntax

Recommended Background Reading

## Workshop Participation

Sudents will be expected to participate in the workshop in a hands-on way, following along with the code provided and performing  exercises.

## _R_ / _Bioconductor_ packages used

* tidyverse
* tidyBulk
* tidyHeatmap
* edgeR
* devtools

# Workshop goals and objectives

List "big picture" student-centered workshop goals and learning
objectives. Learning goals and objectives are related, but not the
same thing. These goals and objectives will help some people to decide
whether to attend the conference for training purposes, so please make
these as precise and accurate as possible.

*Learning goals* are high-level descriptions of what
participants will learn and be able to do after the workshop is
over. *Learning objectives*, on the other hand, describe in very
specific and measurable terms specific skills or knowledge
attained. The [Bloom's Taxonomy](#bloom) may be a useful framework
for defining and describing your goals and objectives, although there
are others.

## Learning goals

* learn how RNA-Seq count data can be analysed in a tidy way
* understand key steps in analysis of RNA-Seq counts
* evaluate RNA-Seq counts using visualisations

## Learning objectives

* analyse RNA-Seq counts in tidy data format
* produce a list of differentially expressed genes
* create visualisations of gene expression


### A note about learning goals and objectives (#bloom)

While not a new or modern system for thinking about learning,
[Bloom's taxonomy][1] is one useful framework for understanding the
cognitive processes involved in learning. From lowest to highest
cognitive requirements:

1. Knowledge: Learners must be able to recall or remember the
   information.
2. Comprehension: Learners must be able to understand the information.
3. Application: Learners must be able to use the information they have
   learned at the same or different contexts.
4. Analysis: Learners must be able to analyze the information, by
   identifying its different components.
5. Synthesis: Learners must be able to create something new using
   different chunks of the information they have already mastered.
6. Evaluation: Learners must be able to present opinions, justify
   decisions, and make judgments about the information presented,
   based on previously acquired knowledge.

To use Bloom's taxonomy, consider the following sets of verbs and
descriptions for learning objectives:

1. Remember: Memorize, show, pick, spell, list, quote, recall, repeat,
   catalogue, cite, state, relate, record, name.
2. Understand: Explain, restate, alter, outline, discuss, expand,
   identify, locate, report, express, recognize, discuss, qualify,
   covert, review, infer.
3. Apply: Translate, interpret, explain, practice, illustrate,
   operate, demonstrate, dramatize, sketch, put into action, complete,
   model, utilize, experiment, schedule, use.
4. Analyze: Distinguish, differentiate, separate, take apart,
   appraise, calculate, criticize, compare, contrast, examine, test,
   relate, search, classify, experiment.
5. Evaluate: Decide, appraise, revise, score, recommend, select,
   measure, argue, value, estimate, choose, discuss, rate, assess,
   think.
6. Create: Compose, plan, propose, produce, predict, design, assemble,
   prepare, formulate, organize, manage, construct, generate, imagine,
   set-up.
