\usage{
get_scaled_counts_bulk(
  .data,
  .sample = NULL,
  .transcript = NULL,
  .abundance = NULL,
  factor_of_interest = NULL,
  minimum_counts = 10,
  minimum_proportion = 0.7,
  method = "TMM",
  reference_selection_function = median
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A tibble}

\item{.sample}{The name of the sample column}

\item{.transcript}{The name of the transcript/gene column}

\item{.abundance}{The name of the transcript/gene abundance column}

\item{factor_of_interest}{The name of the column of the factor of interest. This is used for identifying lowly abundant transcript, to be ignored for calculating scaling fators.}

\item{minimum_counts}{A positive integer. Minimum counts required for at least some samples.}

\item{minimum_proportion}{A real positive number between 0 and 1. It is the threshold of proportion of samples for each transcripts/genes that have to be characterised by a cmp bigger than the threshold to be included for scaling procedure.}

\item{method}{A character string. The scaling method passed to the backend function (i.e., edgeR::calcNormFactors; "TMM","TMMwsp","RLE","upperquartile")}

\item{reference_selection_function}{A function between median, mean and max}
}
\value{
A tibble including additional columns
